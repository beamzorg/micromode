# Changelog

## 0.1.0a6 - 2026-06-20

- Added the BEAMZ discrete mode contract with mode-plane metadata, component
  profiles, backward fields, and diagnostics.
- Added BEAMZ-oriented field staggering, cropping, phase referencing, and
  power-normalization paths.
- Added regression coverage for BEAMZ mode-plane validation and component
  profile behavior.
- Tightened type annotations around BEAMZ mode candidates, axes, and component
  indices so Pyright passes cleanly.

## 0.1.0a5 - 2026-05-23

- Made the SciPy reference solver the default backend and removed the Rust
  backend from the package.
- Added sparse SciPy operator coverage, fixture parity checks, and solver
  benchmark comparisons against matched Tidy3D profiles.
- Improved numerical handling for anisotropic, PML, interpolation, and sweep
  diagnostic paths.
- Expanded examples and documentation for hybridization sweeps, material-grid
  demos, backend trust, release workflow, and solver method details.
- Tightened release artifact checks for pure-Python wheels and refreshed package
  dependency constraints.

## 0.1.0a4 - 2026-05-20

- Fixed y-normal field mapping so returned global fields use a right-handed
  basis and physical +y power overlap is positive.
- Added regression coverage for the y-normal power-overlap sign and tightened
  API type-checking coverage.
- Added a Tidy3D modal sources and monitors example with README documentation
  and refreshed generated documentation assets.
- Updated the ridge-waveguide README example to show an angled slab on a
  substrate with complex fundamental mode fields.
- Added stricter lint, type-check, and release metadata checks to CI.
- Hardened example input validation, HDF5 solver metadata loading, and sparse
  solver edge-case handling.

## 0.1.0a3

Initial alpha release candidate.

- Added grid-first Python API for rasterized mode solving.
- Added sparse shift-invert solver support.
- Added 2D cross-section solves and 1D slice solves.
- Added scalar, diagonal anisotropic, and tensor material grids.
- Added six-component field reconstruction.
- Added deterministic phase convention, unit-power normalization, and Lorentz orthogonalization.
- Added mode metrics, overlaps, plotting helpers, HDF5 save/load, and dataframe export.
- Added ridge-waveguide README example and generated plot asset.
- Added Apache-2.0 license, CI, coverage, and release packaging setup.
